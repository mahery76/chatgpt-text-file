Tips and tricks to get strong against freezing weather
--------------------------
Here are some tips and tricks to help you stay strong against freezing weather:

Dress in layers to help trap warm air close to your body. Start with a moisture-wicking base layer, add an insulation layer, and finish with a waterproof and windproof outer layer.

Protect your head, hands, and feet, as these are areas where heat is most likely to escape from your body. Wear a warm hat, gloves or mittens, and insulated boots.

Take extra care to stay dry. Wet clothing can rapidly chill your body, which can lead to hypothermia.

Eat high-energy foods to keep your body warm. Soups, stews, and hot drinks are good choices.

Stay active to help generate heat. Take short walks, do some light exercises or stretching during your break.

Keep your living space warm. Keep your home at a comfortable temperature, especially if you spend a lot of time indoors.

Stay informed about the weather forecast and take necessary precautions if extreme cold temperatures are expected.

Check on your elderly or vulnerable friends, family and neighbours, as they may be more at risk in freezing weather.

If you are traveling in snowy or icy conditions, be sure to have a winter emergency kit in your vehicle.
