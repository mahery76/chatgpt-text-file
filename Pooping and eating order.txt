Do we have to poop before going to eat , or eat before going to poop ?
--------------------------
There is no strict rule about when you should poop or eat. It is ultimately up to you and your personal preference. Some people may feel more comfortable going to the bathroom before eating, while others may prefer to eat first and then go to the bathroom afterwards. There is no one "correct" way to do it. It is important to listen to your body and do what feels most natural and comfortable for you.
