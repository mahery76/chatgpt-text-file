How to round float in javascript
--------------------------
You can use the Math.round() function to round a float to the nearest integer in JavaScript. For example, Math.round(3.14) would return 3, and Math.round(3.6) would return 4.

You can also use the Math.floor() function to round down to the nearest integer, or the Math.ceil() function to round up to the nearest integer.

To round to a specific decimal place, you can use the toFixed() method. For example, 3.14159265358979323846.toFixed(2) would return "3.14"

You can also use Number.prototype.toFixed(n) to round a number to n decimal places.
